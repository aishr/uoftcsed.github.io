Petri Ihantola is an Assistant Professor (tenure-track) of Software Engineering in the Department of Pervasive Computing at the Tampere University of Technology in Finland. Before starting in Tampere in 2014, he worked at Aalto University from where he received his Ph.D. in 2011, and at Google from 2007 till 2009, first in Ireland and later in Switzerland. Ihantola has been a visiting scholar at the Stanford University in the Lytics (Learning Analytics) Lab between 2014 and 2015. His research has revolved around software engineering, and educational software, today with a particular focus on smart content, automated assessment, mobile learning, and learning analytics in computer science education for over ten years (see <a href="http://tinyurl.com/petri-ihantola">http://tinyurl.com/petri-ihantola</a>).

In his presentation, entitled as Learning Analytics in Programming, Ihantola will discuss on what automatically collected data tells us about students' programming process. Since the 60's automated assessment in programming has targeted on the final outcomes, i.e. whether code submitted by a student is good or not. However, the path of how students end up perhaps to an identical solution may be totally different and the related programming session traces can provide valuable insights from learners and their skills. Previously, his work analyzed data recorded from IDEs, and more recently his collaborators have combined that to other data sources such as browsing history.
