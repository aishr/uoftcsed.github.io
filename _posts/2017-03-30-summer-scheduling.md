Thanks to everyone who attended reading groups this fall and winter. We had 6-8 people
each week in the winter, and we developed a focus on literature around diversity.

This summer, we'll be shifting our location to the StG campus, to get the faculty and
graduate students there engaged in the group, but undergraduates are very welcome to 
attend! If you're interested in joining us, please [fill in your availability](http://doodle.com/poll/e74x3826xnts4tu2). While the poll only includes one week, please pick times that work for you throughout 
the summer. We'll be meeting weekly.

We'll send out details about the final time and location in mid-April.
