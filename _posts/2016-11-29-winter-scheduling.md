The fall term reading group was a lot of fun. About 9 of us met each week to share ideas about this year's ICER papers.
We're hoping to run a similar undergraduate-focused reading group at UTM and on skype in the winter term. If you're interested in joining us, please [fill in your availability](http://doodle.com/poll/p626z7sfbci24br6). While the poll only includes one week in the winter term, please pick times that work for you throughout the semester. We'll be meeting weekly.

We'll send out details about the final time and location in late December.
